# Gradebook

This is a C program that uses command line arguments and reading and writing to text files in order to comput the final grades of each student in a class.

The program creates a format to store grades in a text file and writes a program that calculates the overall grade by reading the grades of each student and applying a specified weight to each category. Afterwards, the program writes the overall grade and names of students in another text file that will represent the gradebook. Furhermore,the program is composed of a Makefile to simplify and organize code from the various files. 

For example, create a text file to store grades of students in this order: First Name, Last Name, homework1, homework2, homework3, quiz1, quiz2, test, test2, project, final exam. Present this order in the created text file with no commas. The only letters used are for the first and last name, while the homeworks, quizzes, tests and other categories are inputted as numerical values representing the grades for each respective category. Write one line per student and their grades like so:
